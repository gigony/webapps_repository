Version 0.95.8 (Development)

Changes from 0.95.7

* security fixes

Installation

1.  Extract the file to your DocumentRoot

e.g.    # tar xvfz aphpkb-x.xx.x.tgz -C /-documentroot-/

1.1 For Linux/Unix, check that you have the correct permissions and ownership.

e.g.,  
        # cd /-documentroot-/
        # chmod 755 -R ./aphpkb
        # chown -R apache:apache ./aphpkb
        
	another example (using MacOSX),

	# cd /Library/WebServer/Documents/
	# chmod 775 -R ./aphpkb
	# chown -R www:devuser ./aphpkb
	
1.2 Additionally, 'the attach' folder should have permissions for read-write by the owner but not execution permissions

	# cd /path-to-aphpkb/
	# chmod 600 ./attach

2.  Create the Database

# mysql -u [database user]
 mysql> create database akb;
 mysql> use akb;
 mysql> exit
# mysql -u [database user] akb < /path-to-aphpkb/docs/akb.sql

Where 'akb' is the database name.

3.  Knowledgebase setup

Access:

http://your-url-to-aphpkb/install/

If Aphpkb has not been setup yet, the page will display this file, the next step is to click
on the Step 1 - Database link on the menu.

It is important that once the final step has taken place, that the database has been created
from item 2 on this guide.
